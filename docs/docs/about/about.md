Jan is a [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) tool to [create, customize and use AI](https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents) for everyday tasks.

You can:

- Run locally using [open-source LLMs](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation) or connect to cloud AIs like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) or [Google](https://ai.google.dev/)
- Fine-tune AI with specific knowledge
- Search the web and other databases
- Connect AI to your everyday tools and (with your permission) do work on your behalf

Longer-term, Jan is building a cognitive framework for future robots. We envision a world where we have personal or company robots that we continually improve and customize, growing together with us.

## Why do we exist

At Jan, our mission is to advance human-machine collaboration. We achieve this through delivering the best open-source, local-first tools to allow users to run, customize and tinker with AI.

## How do I get it?

You can install and start using Jan in less than 5 minutes, from [jan.ai](https://jan.ai) or our [Github repo](https://github.com/janhq/jan).

You can read the [User Guide](/docs/user-guide) if you need some help to get started.

## What license is the code under?

Jan is licensed under the [AGPLv3 License](https://github.com/janhq/jan/blob/main/LICENSE).

We happily accept pull requests, however, we do ask that you sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) so that we have the right to relicense your contributions[^2].

We also have a [Contributor Program](/docs/team/contributor-program) to provide ownership and upside to contributors who have made significant contributions to the project.

## What was it built with?

[Jan](https://github.com/janhq/jan) is pragmatically built using `Typescript` at the application level and `C++` at the Inference level (which we have refactored into [Nitro](https://nitro.jan.ai)[^3]).

We follow [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and currently support multiple frameworks and runtimes:

- A desktop client with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- A headless server-mode with [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Planned support for mobile with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)
- Planned support for Python runtime

Architecturally, we have made similar choices to the [Next.js Enterprise Javascript Stack](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-enterprise-boilerplate), which is a [battle-tested](https://nextjs.org/showcase/enterprise) framework for building enterprise-grade applications that scale.

:::tip

**At its core, Jan is a software development kit to build and run copilots on personal devices**. The Desktop Client many folks use is, rather, a specific set of extensions packaged by default. We're excited to see what developers do with the SDK (once its in better shape).
