## Own your AI. Own your data. Own your IP.

Over time, we expect more teams and organizations to turn to running their own AIs on-prem.

**Why?**

- Prevent shadow data
- Avoid vendor lock-in
- Keep your IP in house
- Uptime and support predictability
- Eliminate monthly API bills - use your existing hardware
- Full control over your AI - you can open it up and see what's going on

## Why Jan Enterprise

### Fast deployment

- **1 click deployment**. Immediately serve, customize, and scale models and assistants across your org. Scale your AI team so they can focus on the IP instead of fixing plumbing across every computer.
- **Scale across infrastructures**: on premise, with cloud providers, or as a hybrid deployment. Run Jan in completely air-gapped environments.
- **Optimized for datacenter-grade GPUs**: Can run on Nvidia, AMD Hardware, or even normal CPUs. Use TensorRT-LLM for more speedups on A6000s and above.

### Full customization

- Runs custom models or popular LLMs like Llama2, Mistral at production scale
- API that is fully OpenAI-compatible, i.e. can be a drop-in migration
- Powerful Agent framework to customize LLMs using RAG or Enterprise Data integrations.
