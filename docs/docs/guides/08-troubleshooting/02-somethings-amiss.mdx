Previously labelled "Failed to fetch" error.

You may receive a "Something's amiss" response when you first start chatting with a selected model.

This may occur due to several reasons. Please follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Ensure you are on the latest version of Mac, Windows, or Ubuntu OS version

   - Upgrading to the latest version has resolved this issue for most people

2. Select a model that is smaller than 80% of your hardware V/RAM.

   - For example, if you have an 8GB machine, you should select models smaller than 6GB.

3. Install the latest [Nightly release](https://jan.ai/install/nightly/)

   - If you are re-installing Jan, it can help to [clear the application cache](https://jan.ai/troubleshooting/stuck-on-broken-build/).

4. Ensure your V/RAM is accessible by the application (some people have virtual RAM).

5. If you are on Nvidia GPUs, please download [Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

6. If you're using Linux, please ensure that your system meets the following requirements gcc 11, g++ 11, cpp 11, or higher, refer to this [link](https://jan.ai/guides/troubleshooting/gpu-not-used/#specific-requirements-for-linux) for more information.

7. When [checking app logs](https://jan.ai/troubleshooting/how-to-get-error-logs/), if you encounter the error log `Bind address failed at 127.0.0.1:3928`, it indicates that the port used by Nitro might already be in use. Use the following commands to check the port status:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
    
    ```bash
    netstat -an | grep 3928
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
    
    ```sh
    netstat -ano | find "3928" 
    tasklist /fi "PID eq 3928"
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    
    ```sh
    netstat -anpe | grep "3928" 
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
