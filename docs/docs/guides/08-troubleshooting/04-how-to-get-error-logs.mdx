To get the error logs of Jan, you can navigate to the `~/jan/logs` directory through `Settings` > `Advanced` > `Open App Directory`.

- Open the `app.log` file if you are using UI.
- Open the `error.log` file for error logs if you are using the local API server.

```bash
# Using UI
tail -n 50 ~/jan/logs/app.log

# Using local api server
tail -n 50 ~/jan/logs/server.log
```

- When sharing logs or error information, make sure to redact any private or sensitive information.
