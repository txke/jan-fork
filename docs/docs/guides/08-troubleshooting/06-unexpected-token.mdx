You may receive an error response `Error occurred: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE"...is not valid JSON`, when you start a chat with OpenAI models. 

1. Check that you added an OpenAI API key. You can get an API key from OpenAI's [developer platform](https://platform.openai.com/). Alternatively, we recommend you download a local model from Jan Hub, which remains free to use and runs on your own computer!

2. Using a VPN may help fix the issue.
