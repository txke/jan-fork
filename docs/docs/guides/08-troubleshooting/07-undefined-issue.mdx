2. If the issue persists, try to go `~/jan/extensions/@janhq/inference-nitro-extensions/dist/bin/<your-os>/nitro` and run the nitro manually and see if you get any error messages.
3. Resolve the error messages you get from the nitro and see if the issue persists.
4. Reopen the Jan app and see if the issue is resolved.
5. If the issue persists, please share with us the [app logs](https://jan.ai/troubleshooting/how-to-get-error-logs/) via [Jan Discord](https://discord.gg/mY69SZaMaC).
